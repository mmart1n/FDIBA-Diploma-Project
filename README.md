# FDIBA-Teaching-Assignments

This is an Angular application for management of the teaching assignments for the needs of the Technical University of Sofia. I have developed it as part of my graduation assignment.  

This WEB system would allow lecturers and their assistants to allocate and track study hours that they commit to. The goal of the platform is to automate the distribution and provide transparency of the busyness of the university academic personnel. This application supports the following features:
-	Creating accounts for university personnel
-	Managing specialties, semesters and subjects related to them
-	Creating and modifying study hour assignments for the lecturers and their assistants
-	Admin user accounts reserved for the university dean, or other authorised personnel with increased privileges
-	E-mail notifications for all relevant changes per user
-	Intuitive summary of all subjects that still have unallocated hours

The components implemented from the [IgniteUI for Angular library](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/general/angular-grid-overview-guide) add an emphasis on functionality, like the igxGrid â€“ a table-like feature that makes applying changes, creating, or deleting entities an easy task.

## Angular features, I have used developing this application:
1. Angular Router
2. Route guards (Can-Activate, Can-Deactivate, Role Guards)
3. Interceptors
4. Resolvers
5. Generic Components
6. Directives
7. Components, extending classes and directives
8. Ahead of time compilation
9. Lazy loading modules
10. Shared module
11. HttpClient
12. RxJS Operators
13. NGRX State Management
14. Services
15. initAppService
16. Template Driven Forms
17. Reactive Forms
18. Custom Validators
19. Custom pipes
20. Two-Way bindable properties

## Important:
1. At the time I have developed this application I have been working (and I still do) for Infragistics, Inc as an Associate Software Developer, contributing for the developement of the IgniteUI for Angular Library.
2. The framework used as a Back-End is Spring Boot and it is stored within a private repository.
